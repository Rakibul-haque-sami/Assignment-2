# Qsn 1 task 3.1 : Using any in-built library present in Python, count the occurrences of the words  in the text (.txt) and give the ‘Top 30’ most common words consist of letter. The code should not count special character as a word.  And store the ‘Top 30’ common words and their counts into a CSV file.
